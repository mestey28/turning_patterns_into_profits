# Project Components

We are a retail consulting service provider. Our client is a boutique shop with 4 channels of distribution. We have been asked to take a look at their customer base to see how we can better reach their customers to increase size of purchase and maintain customers for a longer period of time. 

# Analytics in Retail:

Our plan is to use analytic insights to engage customers more effectively and build loyalty. Using advanced analytics and machine learning to identify patterns and trends of customers habits, we are able to drive product recommendations by market and product category to take any business to the next level.

-Understand customersâ€™ behaviors over time to more effectively map their buyer journeys. 

-Identify and segment your customers by their propensity to buy, incorporating demographic, geographic, psychographic, and social data to launch more effective campaigns.


We built reports summarizing customer behavior using metrics such as conversion rate, average order value, recency of purchase and total amount spent in recent transactions. These measurements provided general insight into the behavioral tendencies of customers.
